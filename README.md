## PyBank Sources:

To create the `Change` List and `average_change` , I used Xpert Learning Assistant for reviewing and correcting the code for the list.

Xpert Learning Assistant was also used to review and correct my codes for the following:
> Calculating Max/Min Values with its corresponding months.
>> `max_change_index`, `max_change_month`, `min_change_index`, `min_change_month`


## PyPoll Sources:

Xpert Learning Assistant was used to review and correct my codes for the following:

> Creating the `for` statement when calculating the `candidate` and their respective `percentage`, `count`.

> Correcting how to calculate the `winner` with its respective votes.
